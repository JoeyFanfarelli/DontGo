#Created with Unity C#

#*Gameplay*

#	Two paddles are controlled independently (WASD and IJKL keys) by one or two players. 

#     	Points are scored when the ball collides with the center block.
#     	The trajectory of the ball is based on which part of the paddle it hits.
#	Cooperation between the paddles results in a higher score. If the ball hits the other paddle immediately after hitting one paddle, the score multiplier increases. 

#*Features*

#	Relaxing atmospheric game
#	Randomly-selected goals to augment gameplay
#	Soft glow-lighting
#	Code-based animations

#*Known bugs*

#	Rarely, when the ball collides with a paddle while spawning, it will behave erratically.
#	Rarely, the camera shake will become overly aggressive, but quickly fade away.
#	If the ball hits the precise corner of the center block, it will slide along the block's edge, rather than ricocheting.


#I created everything except the music, font, and background image.
